NAME
       socket - create an endpoint for communication

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>          /* See NOTES */
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

DESCRIPTION
       socket()  creates  an endpoint for communication and returns a descrip‐ tor.
 RETURN VALUE
 On  success,  a  file  descriptor  for  the new socket is returned.  On
       error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
       
NAME
       bind - bind a name to a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>          /* See NOTES */
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
                socklen_t addrlen);

DESCRIPTION
       When  a  socket  is  created  with socket(2), it exists in a name space
       (address family) but has no address assigned to it.  bind() assigns the
       address  specified  by  addr  to  the  socket  referred  to by the file
       descriptor sockfd.  addrlen  specifies  the  size,  in  bytes,  of  the
       address structure pointed to by addr.  Traditionally, this operation is
       called “assigning a name to a socket”.
       
 RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set appropriately.
